Why should we use React for the front-end?

There are many frameworks and libraries available for frontend development. Not all of them are good, React is a popular and  open-source JavaScript libraryand it is used for front-end development that was created by Facebook in 2011. It's a JavaScript library that developers use to build user interfaces. With its component-based architecture, developers can create reusable UI components that can be used across multiple projects.


React is commonly used for Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Client-Side Rendered (CSR) applications. SPAs involve a browser receiving a single static HTML document and a JS file with virtual DOM that renders everything else. Developers can also integrate React with other technologies to create full-stack applications, like MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and React (MERN) Stack.

React is easy to learn and that is one of the most important reasons to choose this library. As it doesn‚Äôt take much time to learn this technology, you can quickly become a React developer.

If a technology is hard to learn, you will probably find it difficult to start. That, as it happens, it‚Äôs human nature. We avoid things that are hard to learn.

React is easy to learn not just because there are a great number of easy-to-understand tutorials available on the internet but mainly because it‚Äôs a very simple library. Unlike Angular, it‚Äôs not a complex tool. The learning process becomes easier when you have great JavaScript skills.

React lets you build rich user-interfaces easily. Quality of user-interfaces is important because a poorly designed user-interface is generally less user-friendly and the users will not like a poorly designed UI. If your web app has cool, high-quality UIs, your users will love to use your app. So building high-quality user-interfaces is crucial to business success. Yes, you can build cool interfaces with other technologies too, but React lets you do it easily using the declarative components.

You can increase your productivity by using the reusable components and development tools. Developer‚Äôs productivity is important because if you can get things done quickly, you can earn more money in less time, which is a common goal of companies and startups. If it takes a huge amount of time to build a simple thing, you‚Äôll lose money. On the contrary, if you can deliver products quickly, you can earn cash quickly and your clients will also be happy.
There are many development tools available for React which speed up your work. For example, there‚Äôs a browser extension called React Developer Tools, which can make your coding work a lot easier.

React is used by great companies and startups such as Facebook, Dropbox, Khan Academy, CodeAcademy, Netflix, Airbnb, PayPal, Walmart, Tesla Motors, IMDb, and so on. There are many, many popular apps that use React.
Why are so many great companies and startups using this technology? The answer is that it‚Äôs undoubtedly a very high-quality tool for frontend development. Considering that super successful companies like Facebook and PayPal use React, that must mean that it‚Äôs a truly useful library.

We have learned from this post that React has impressive benefits. So does Angular! So why should we use React? Why not Angular or any other framework?
Not all frameworks and libraries will be the right fit for your work. They can be great tools but may not be the ideal choice for your development work. Just like React, Angular is also a great, high-quality framework and it‚Äôs also been developed by the technology giant ‚Äì Google.

But there‚Äôs a problem with Angular which makes React better in my opinion. The problem is that Angular is hard to learn as it‚Äôs not a simple framework. It‚Äôs a very complex framework for frontend development. On the other hand, React is a very simple, easy-to-use technology.

In summary, React is a powerful technology for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture, Virtual DOM, and JSX syntax make it a popular choice for developers. Whether building a single-page application or a complex full-stack application, React has everything developers need to do so efficiently.
